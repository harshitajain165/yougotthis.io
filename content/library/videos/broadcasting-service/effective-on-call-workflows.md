    Being on call can be a tiring and thankless task, and while the on-call
    process depends on each team setup, the on-call pain is the same for
    everyone. Building sustainable practices is critical in keeping your team
    positive and productive. This talk will walk you through a data-driven
    on-call framework that you an apply for your own teams leading to a happier,
    healthier on-call process. Weâ€™ll also reflect on how it works in-practice
