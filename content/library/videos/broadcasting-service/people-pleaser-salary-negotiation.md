    Negotiating salaries is hard. It's harder if you have a pathological need
    for people to like you. If you don't negotiate you will fall behind your
    peers and won't reach your full earning potential. This talk demystifies
    negotiation and empowers the attendees to earn as much as their peers while
    staying true to their personality. This talk is for people who can't sleep
    at night because they accidentally said something borderline rude three
    years ago and still feel bad about it.
