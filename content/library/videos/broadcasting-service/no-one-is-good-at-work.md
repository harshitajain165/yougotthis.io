    It's very easy to scroll through your social media feeds and see nothing bit
    highly productive people, but this is often not the full reality. Broken
    habits, sleepless nights, and failed projects are a part of life. In this
    discussion, Floor and Kevin will discuss the perceptions of their work and
    the reality, in an effort to start a conversation about what is healthy and
    reasonable.
