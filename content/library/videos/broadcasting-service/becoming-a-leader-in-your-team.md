    Understand how to navigate the challenges of making a transition from peer
    to boss.
  full: >-
    One of the most difficult transitions to make is from being a member of the
    team, to owning your former teammates performance reviews. It is awkward. It
    is stressful. And you can do it! In this session, we'll take a look at the
    challenges of making this transition and how you can face them head on.
    Leveraging the years of experience I've built up, you can learn from my
    healthy backlog of failures, poor decisions, and generally bad ideas. These
    mistakes were what helped me to learn, and now you can too!
