    Learn about applying inclusive language, and rolling with the punches when
    you make mistakes.
  full: >-
    Respect and inclusion are key to a collaborative, healthy work environment,
    and that’s made harder by the fact that language, especially around gender
    and sexuality, evolves so quickly. In this talk, we’ll go through some
    examples of more gender-inclusive language, methods for practicing, and
    strategies for rolling with the punches when we make mistakes. By the end of
    the talk, you’ll feel confident in navigating the changing language around
    gender and sexuality.
