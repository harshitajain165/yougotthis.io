    Sometimes apologies don't quite *feel* right, and it can be hard to figure
    out why. Often, it's because they weren't really apologies; they were
    performances made to deflect responsibility, excuse away behavior, and with
    the hopes of calming negative feelings. Whether you've received one of these
    types or given them yourself, this talk will allow you to recognize what
    makes a good and authentic apology and how to construct one yourself.
