  full: >-
    Have you ever thought to yourself, “Why can’t I do that?”, “They ALWAYS do
    the cool stuff!”, “How did they get there?? They’re an overnight success”,
    and “They must have done X to get there”. These feelings are human, yet
    you’re not alone if they make you go “ew”. Watching others live instead of
    the life you want to live. How do we have less “ew”? We will talk about the
    steps we take to get out of our comfort zone to start going from “Why can’t
    I do that?” to “Damn, I did that!” with the mastery of saying “Fuck it!”
