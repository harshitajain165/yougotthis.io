  full: >-
    If you’re working in software, the primary function of your role is to turn
    human and programming languages into common understanding. As you work with
    your team and collective members, the way you use human languages around
    your work can have major impacts, even when we don’t intend it to. Together
    we’ll explore the cultural basis for how we shape the language we use. Let’s
    explore how and when to avoid analogies and ambiguous language. By the end
    of this talk, we hope that you’ll be ready to use the ideas and tips shared
    to help move towards collective understanding with your team.
