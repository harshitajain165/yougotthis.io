    The first few years in any new career is daunting. It can feel isolating and
    overwhelming if there isn't someone to shadow or tap on the shoulder when
    things get hard. However, you don't know what you don't know. This is made
    further complicated with remote office culture and navigating teams spread
    over different time zones and different cultures and markets. Teams need to
    be intentional in how they onboard these new hires. We will walkthrough the
    strategies to establish good remote workflows and communication. This talk
    is for anyone with interns and junior contributors on their team. I also aim
    to help new hires make sure they know what they need to know when starting
    out in their new roles.
