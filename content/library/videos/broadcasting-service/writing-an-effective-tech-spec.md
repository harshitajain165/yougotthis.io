    While most people associate software engineering with writing code, figuring
    out what to build and how to do it is half the battle. Tech specs are an
    invaluable tool for clarifying ambiguity and keeping teams focused on a
    common goal. This talk will go through what makes a tech spec useful, the
    general anatomy of a tech spec, and how to tailor one to fit your teamâ€™s
    unique needs. This talk is for software engineers new to leading projects,
    as well as experienced engineers looking to introduce or rethink their
    technical planning process.
