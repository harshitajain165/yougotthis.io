Hello, everyone.  Today we're going to speak about how to quit with confidence, but it's Àmber Shand.  And tech podcast and I've changed the name of the newsletters.  It's called own your wins and you can is check out your Web site Àmber Shand.co.uk.  

I've had nine jobs, professional retail.  And I've quit 7 of them.  I was quite nervous quitting as intern in a professional setting and I've had eight written notices.  We're talking about confidences.  

So in this context we're talking about self-confidence and according to psychology online it's individual's trust they can face challenges and demands.  So in the context of quitting it may feel daunting.  Feel the fear and do it anyway, my confidence can be fleeting, I have off days when you skyed to quit you may feel a range of emotions anxiety, guilt, relief, uncertainty, excitement, fear, nervousness, frustrated.  I've felt all this.

The most fear-inducing time is when I actually really enjoyed my work.  I loved my team and I was scared but I did love them.  And there's been times I'm like whoo, people, she's out of here.  I wouldn't go back to those days.  Today's the 5-step plan and first step is to remember why.  Why are you quitting.  There may be different regions and that's something you see yourself that you want to progress in and work as.  

You may be frustrated with the lack of progression is that you're experiencing within your company.  You can be unsatisfied with your current compensation package.  Manager may be toxic, but I want you to know is your reason is important to you.  If you want to leave those questions is will your skills be best suited at a different company or career?  I have a degree in economics and accounting.  I wasn't in the finance world and I taught myself how to code over the pandemic.  I don't want to pursue finance but I want to pursue being a engineer and coding.  

Another question to ask.  Are you working in a toxic environment?  Some environments don't serve us to reach our full potential and have motivation levels to stick it out and to work on projects.  Another is do you have opportunities to grow in your career, that's an important question to ask because if the current company isn't serving that it may be best to find someone else who will.  Are you satisfied with your compensation package.  We saw great resignation happen in 2020. People asking for more and getting more.  If your company is paying a competitive rate.  

Do you have good work-life balance?  This depends on where you are and where your priorities are.  Not everyone wants to work in a fast paced environment. That gives you more time to essentially have more balance and does the job offer flexibility.  That was -- leaving is easy.  With you're working at a company for time.  It doesn't mean it's an easy process to go through.  Some questions you might like.  

Some questions I have people have had are questions like what if I disappoint my colleagues for living?  Am I ready to leave yet?  Maybe stick it out longer, what am I going to say to a manager when I leave.  This comes from self-doubt.  If I have a manager not supporting me, what if I leave to go to a different job and it's worse, what is the manager is mean and what this if they promise a great deal and can't back it up.  I'm here to tell you we'll get back to.  I'm feeling like sometimes it can be helpful to recognize how you feel and remembering your why in the process.  

I'm feeling relieved about quitting and I'm leaving because I'm ready for a change.  And with contract signed, I was looking for another role and I was just got off a letter and I was strongly advised to only quit when you have the contract signed because at least it's guaranteed and also a safety net can be plans to take a break and up skill.  I see a lot of people doing a coding bootcamp to travel and unwind and going back to a job that's already lined up or traveling and I would highly like you to have enough savings to make it last to foster that kind of safety net for yourself.  

Step 3 is definitely to reach out to your manager first one of the worst things we can do is for our manager to find out from someone else that we plan to leave and that links to leaving on good terms, this is one of the first things you can do.  So starts with scenario saying I'm ready to quit.  Notice period in mind.  Today is the day and this day I'm going to be telling my manager.  So you can message your manager something along the lines are you free for a quick chat.  Hopefully manager around soon or later that day and sometimes they may not have the times to have a quibbling chat.  Something to say hi, normal formalities. 

You can say I want to tell you first because I think it's right thing to do I'm resigning effective from today I have an opportunity and I want to thank for the opportunities they lined you with support, guidance.  Development and mentorship and hopefully they respond well.  In my experiences they have.  

I've had people without a great experience they said to me is there anyway we can keep you.  At the time the answer was no because I already made decision.  This is why it's so important for you to go in knowing your intentions your plan is to quit the role, I advise you to stay strong.  If they say higher salary or move me to a different team, you may decide to stay.  I would not necessarily be accepting the counteroffer but depends what your priorities are.  

Step 4, last time I had conversation with manager, leaving, nothing you can do to make me stay.  After our talk I'll send you formal resignation letter or email.  I feel like they came up with a really solid answer.  It says dear manager's name, I'm writing to inform you that I have decided to redesign from my position.  I truly appreciate the opportunity to work with such a dedicated and talented team.  Experiences and skills I gained from my time at as I move on to new communities.  I want to thank you for the support and guidance.  I want to show you I will do everything in my power to allow a smooth transition.  I wish the company and my colleagues all the best the future.  Thank you for time and opportunities provided to me sincerely.  I felt are that was a good one.  

Step 5 is leaving on good terms, not bad-mouthing the company or people who worked there.  Speaking diplomatically about it.  You may need to produce a handover.  With that I would recommend you speaking to manager about it.  Organizing how you balance time and making time to do the requirements and also keep momentum up.  Sometimes it can affect your personal brand if you momentum and will to work during notice period.  Lucky enough at previous place that was a good way to explain things working with well.  

Hearing changes think were going to make in terms of hearing that that's a great thing for employers and also for employees to stay as you leave as well.  There's several reasons why it's beneficial to leave on good terms.  Especially while you're working in industry, it can be beneficial to be known as known for producing good work.  Also two reference previous employers especially.  So we spoke about self-doubt.  

If you're leaving a job similar case to me that you do like your team, it's a great thing to leave on good terms in case new opportunity can't what you thought it would be.  I was working in retail and left my job to go to another retail job and my manager put me in the stockroom for two weeks and I wasn't talking to anyone.  I was just in the stockroom doing whatever.  I just felt my notice period was one month and I can stick this out.  Also another alternative was having a conversation about it.  Just have conversation and I noticed I notice our relationship has changed and I want to work with you and if it's really bad and you can afford it, you can have a conversation about shortening your notice period.  That's negotiable as long as both parties agree.  

That is all.  Recap.  5-step plan.  First is remembering why.  2 is creating a safety net.  Three is reaching out to manager first and third is resignation email and that's 12 team as well.  Warning to team.  Hey by the way, I'm resigning, I'm leaving on this date so they can prepare as well.  5, to leave on good terms.

Thank you for questions.
