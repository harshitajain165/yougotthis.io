    The COVID-19 pandemic and global economic trends like the Great Reshuffle
    have led to a more remote and less-tenured workforce in many organizations.
    Especially for those who started new jobs recently or have made the switch
    to remote or hybrid workplaces, it can sometimes feel difficult to cultivate
    a sense of community. In this talk, we will consider why it is helpful to
    take charge of building connections yourself and explore a variety of
    tactics for participating in and cultivating community in your workplace.
