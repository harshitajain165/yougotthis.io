    Everyone communicates differently, this is especially pronounced for
    neurodivergent people who may struggle with social interaction. We can
    support those around us by learning about these different styles of
    communication, adapting our approached and operating with kindness towards
    others. In this talk, we will look at various different aspects of
    communication differences and suggest some ways you can help yourself and
    help others communicate more effectively. This talk is for people who
    struggle with communication with others and for managers who want to learn
    how to support neurodivergent employees.
