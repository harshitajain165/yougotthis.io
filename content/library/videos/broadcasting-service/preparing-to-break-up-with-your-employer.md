    When you break up with a person, you have pretty common set of steps to
    follow - returning hoodies, splitting up household goods, eating the ice
    cream of sadness. But what are you supposed to do when you break up with an
    employer? In this talk, we'll explore what you need to think about before
    the hard discussions, what you should be ready to do, and how to leave with
    as much dignity and good-will as possible. The target audience is people who
    are trying to get better at this very painful experience without throwing
    their barista apron.
