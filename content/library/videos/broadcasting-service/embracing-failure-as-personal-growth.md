    Failure is scary! Even the idea of failing is scary. But making mistakes is
    the key to growth and strength. Once we accept that we all have failures, we
    can let go of living perfectly, and instead, embrace the present. In this
    talk, Kimberley will talk about why failures are super important, she'll
    share examples from both her own career and the biggest names in tech.
