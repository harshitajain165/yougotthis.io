  full: >-
    Programming can often go from fulfilling skill to burnout-inducing drudgery.
    In this talk, I'll be going over some of the lessons Bob Ross taught me at a
    critical turning point in my career that helped me expand my view beyond the
    narrow, high-pressure box I had created for coding. This talk aimed at
    software engineers in their first few jobs and experienced coders for which
    software has become a lifeless chore rather than a creative expression.
