    Different values, beliefs and behaviors have a strong impact on the way we
    work and relate with others. Though these differences become more
    celebrated, there might be misunderstandings within teams that, managed
    poorly, have a negative effect. Understanding how these interactions play a
    role at work has become even more important as companies hire more diverse
    candidates but, how can we create diverse work environments that support
    individual differences? In this talk, we will review key cultural
    characteristics that influence the way we communicate, work and relate with
    others in the workplace. In the end, weâ€™ll provide strategies the viewer can
    implement with their teams to create welcoming environments and promote
    overall success of team members without losing their cultural identity.
