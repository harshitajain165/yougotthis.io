title: Sponsor You Got This!
---

You Got This! is a learning hub focused on core skills needed for a happy and healthy work life. We offer a free content library and a number of community events.

It is incredibly important to us that speakers and writers are paid for their time, and that all events are accessible, and that increases our running costs. That's where you come in!

<extra-reading title="Sponsor You Got This Around the World Conference (Jan 2024)" class="mt-4">

Our flagship annual conference on January 13 2024 marks both our return to in-person, and an experimental hybrid/distributed format. 

Four simultaneous events will take place in London, New York City, San Francisco, and Remote, each physical event at 10:00-18:00 local. At any point in time, only one speaker will be live in each of the three locations (or fully-remotely). Each event will either be hosting the live speaker, or act as a watch party. We will develop a common layer for networking, socialising, and engaging with sponsors. 

This event is still in the works, but if you want to support it financially or with space to host, please get in touch. Each physical event will be 100-150 people.

- 72.9% of our audience use she/her, they/them, or multiple pronouns.
- 28.7% of our audience are early-career. 30.7% of our audience are seniors or managers+.
- 47% of the audience that attend You Got This events are considering a change in jobs.
- Our audience primarily spans the UK, USA, Ireland, Spain, and Germany.
