title: Sponsor You Got This!
---

You Got This! is a learning hub focused on core skills needed for a happy and healthy work life. We cover themes like self-advocacy, career planning, improving communication, ethics in tech, and pathways to leadership. We offer a free content library and a number of community events.

It is incredibly important to us that speakers and writers are paid for their time, and that all events are accessible, and that increases our running costs. That's where you come in!

## Audience

- 35.6% of our audience as self-taught developers.
- 72.9% of our audience use she/her, they/them, or multiple pronouns.
- 28.7% of our audience are early-career. 30.7% of our audience are seniors or managers.
- 47% of the audience that attend You Got This events are considering a change in jobs.
- Our audience primarily spans the UK, USA, Ireland, Spain, and Germany.

## Conferences

Our hybrid conference - [All Aboard You Got This!](/events/all-aboard) - takes place in London, New York City, San Francisco, and online. It is focused on getting people together to not only learn, but to be able to discuss core skills topics openly. Parts of each event will be constructed into a livestream for remote participants. We will develop a common layer for networking, socialising, and engaging with sponsors.  We expect 100 people in each location, and a further 1500-2000 online. 

We also run a fully-online conference in summer, with remote speaker participation. Sponsorship includes logo visibility (event webpage, livestream, recordings), a 5 minute pre-recorded talk at the event, and 3 tweets of thanks. 

## Meetups

Our meetups typically have 150-200 attendees attend live, and host 3-4 trusted speakers to deliver core skills talks with a live, moderated Q&A. Some meetups have specific themed (communication, freelancing, etc), while others have a more general focus area. All talks are made available in the library after the event.

Sponsorship includes logo visibility (event webpage, livestream, recordings), a 5 minute pre-recorded talk at the event, and 3 tweets of thanks. Each meetup can have up to 4 sponsors.

## Article Releases

We publish new core skills articles three times a year to accompany our video-heavy content library. Each article gets approximately 800 views over the first 30-day period. Each article block can have up to 2 sponsors.

Sponsorship includes 2 custom call-to-actions in each article of the sponsored block, and 3 tweets of thanks.
