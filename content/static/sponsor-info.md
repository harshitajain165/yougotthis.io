title: Sponsor You Got This!
---

You Got This! is a learning hub focused on core skills needed for a happy and healthy work life. We offer a free content library and a number of community events.

It is incredibly important to us that speakers and writers are paid for their time, and that all events are accessible, and that increases our running costs. That's where you come in!

Our flagship annual conference on January 13 2024 marks both our return to in-person, and an experimental hybrid/distributed format.
