<extra-reading title="About You Got This!">

You Got This! is a learning hub focused entirely on core ('soft') skills needed for a happy and healthy work life. Our primary audience is developers, but core skills are important for everyone. We exist because our industry's commitment to teaching core skills isn't good enough, with people at all points in their careers needing to 'just figure it out'. 

The audience:
- 35.6% of our audience as self-taught developers.
- 72.9% of our audience use she/her, they/them, or multiple pronouns.
- 28.7% of our audience are early-career. 30.7% of our audience are seniors or managers+.
- 47% of the audience that attend You Got This events are considering a change in jobs.
- Our audience primarily spans the UK, USA, Ireland, Spain, and Germany.
